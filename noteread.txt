to read the data which we have pushed in an api which is now in redux store 
we have to get the data from store

 so we will use the useSelector hook provided by the react-redux library. 
 
 This hook allows you to extract data from the Redux store's state.

in userDetailSlice create an action for reading data from api

readUser Async Thunk:

This thunk is responsible for making a GET request to the API endpoint to retrieve user data.
It doesn't take any parameters (just an empty object) and dispatches the same three actions as createUser: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
Similarly, it updates the loading state based on the request status and stores the fetched user data in the user array when successful.
If the request fails, it handles the error in the same way as createUser.


When using createAsyncThunk, the second argument passed to the async function (after the first argument, which represents the payload) is an object containing dispatch, getState, and extra properties


In this context, _ is a convention often used to represent an unused parameter. It's a way to indicate that you're not using the first argument passed to the function.


use useSelector hook when we need any state from the redux(global) store
