 we will create a form where a user will add data to the our mock api Create.jsx

created an action for creating user data in the api within the userDetailSlice.jsx

createUser Async Thunk:

This thunk is responsible for making a POST request to the API endpoint to create a new user.
It takes the user data as a parameter and dispatches three different actions based on the state of the request: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.
When the request is pending, it sets the loading state to true.
If the request is successful (fulfilled), it updates the loading state to false and pushes the newly created user data to the user array in the Redux state.
If the request fails (rejected), it sets the loading state to false and stores the error payload in the state.
